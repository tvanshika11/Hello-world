This is a basixc machine learning project made in made colab in python.
Libraries used are numpy,Keras for getting the ANN architecture
MNIST for procuring the dataset of handwritten languages from 0-9.
We were able to get aan accuracy of 12% which is pretty less , but since we lacked GPU, that was it.
We made basically 3layers of our model.
The first two layers contain 64 neurons with "relu" function.
Last layers consisted of 10 neurons and utilised softmax "function".
